I am a software engineer and data scientist based in Kirkland, Washington, with expertise in machine learning, statistical modeling, and audio signal processing. I earned a B.A. in Mathematics from Carleton College, focusing on statistics and computer science, and an M.Sc. in Sound and Music Computing with the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) at Queen Mary University of London, with an emphasis on software engineering, machine learning, and signal processing for audio technologies.

I have four years of experience in healthcare technology and medical devices, with a strong focus on product analytics, statistical modeling, causal inference, and experimental design for clinical marketing and customer-facing data science tools. My experience spans product, sales, marketing, customer service, finance, and research. Recreationally, I am a guitarist, composer, music producer, DJ, and avid bird watcher.

This website highlights my work in AI-driven conservation efforts, machine learning for wildlife monitoring, data science, audio signal processing, information retrieval, and computational creativity.
